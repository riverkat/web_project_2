# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The first thing to be added is a bit more interaction to keep the user more interested. I think an interactive element to the menu, especially to elaborate on ingredients, customizations, and/or potential allergens would be good, as well as photos of the drinks. I would also add a couple of more videos or written recipes to the "recipes" block. I also think a block displaying positive reviews from social media would add more credibility.
